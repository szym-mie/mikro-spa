    <h2>Why JS</h2>

            <h3>Hello world!</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a primary way to make your sites behave dynamic.<br>
                <br>
                Since its introduction in 1995, the language has been evolving constantly to better suit the needs of
                web developers all over the world. This makes JavaScript a very flexible tool, further augmented by
                endless amount of available frameworks such as <a target="_blank" href="https://react.dev/">React</a>, 
                <a target="_blank" src="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>; 
                and many built-in features known as Web API.
            </p>
            <h3>Not only browser</h3>
            <p>
                For a long time JavaScript has been only available in browsers. You had to use different languages
                for everything backend related. This is no more. With the power of <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> you
                can also design and deploy your own servers. While at first it might seem like a completely different world,
                once you get a hold of JavaScript learning backend frameworks such as <a target="_blank" href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>
                will be a breeze.
            </p>
            <h3>Native apps</h3>
            <p>
                But what if you could make an app in JavaScript and have it behave like native app? Well, you can now with 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.electronjs.org/">ElectronJS</a>.
                Both provide great ways to develop native apps both for desktop and mobile.
